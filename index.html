    The mothership has been destroyed due to a collision with a rouge unpredicted planet.
    You and your crew are now lost in space with one small ship. 
    Your job is to collect the bits of scrap metal debris floating around from the destruction of the mothership in order to reconstruct it and fly back to Earth.
